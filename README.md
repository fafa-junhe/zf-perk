# Zombie Fortress Perk Reremake 4.5.4
This is a fork of original zombie fortress perk mode, which is a tf2 zombie sourcemod plugin with perks. 

## What is changed
- In Reremake, I added more perks to make the mode more interesting, such as a perk that can give area buff to humans yet damage to zombies.
- I accidently found a way to partially implement object-oriented functionality in sourcepawn during the development. But it use many macros and dirty method to make it work.

## Next step
- I will focus on the lite branch, because the main branch has a lot of bugs and too many perks that players to choose from.
